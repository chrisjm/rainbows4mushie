This was coded for my neice's 8th birthday.

It started with watching The Coding Train's coding challenge (video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKeyIbT3vXI)). Then I forked [@andrewdcampbell's implementation](https://github.com/andrewdcampbell/jsfireworks). The sound effects are from [soundsnap.com](https://www.soundsnap.com/tags/fireworks).
